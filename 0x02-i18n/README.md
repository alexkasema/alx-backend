# Internationalization and localization
* In computing, internationalization and localization (American) or internationalisation and localisation (British), often abbreviated i18n and l10n respectively, are means of adapting computer software to different languages, regional peculiarities and technical requirements of a target locale.

* Internationalization is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes.
* Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by translating text and adding locale-specific components.
