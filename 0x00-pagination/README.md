# Pagination
Most endpoints that returns a list of entities will need to have some sort of pagination.

Without pagination, a simple search could return millions or even billions of hits causing extraneous network traffic.

Paging requires an implied ordering. By default this may be the itemâ€™s unique identifier, but can be other ordered fields such as a created date.
## 0-simple_helper_function.py
Write a function named index_range that takes two integer arguments page and page_size.

The function should return a tuple of size two containing a start index and an end index corresponding to the range of indexes to return in a list for those particular pagination parameters.

Page numbers are 1-indexed, i.e. the first page is page 1.
